Social Media Platform

Authors: Honor Duthie and Jessica Edmonds 

What does the system do?
This project will create a basic social media platform for short text messages. The user will be able to have an account in which they can post posts and comments. 
In addition, the original posts and comments can be endoresed by endoresment posts. There is also the option to delete posts and comments. Finally, the system 
will generate basic analytical data such as the most endoresed post and most endoresed account. 

How is it implemented?

The code that we are submitting will just be the structure for this project, therefore the system will need to be implemented in accordence to the testing method. 
Our system will not run without a testing framework as there is no main.
